Penny Poll project for LaunchSchool

A distributive voting experiment.
Users can create polls and assign a number of votes per user.
When voting, users can distribute their votes however they wish:
all votes in one option, 50/50 or any other way.

This app is partially in exercise in not using a database
and will probably freak out if it gets too many users doing
too many things at once.
