Penny Poll project for LaunchSchool

A distributive voting experiment.
Users can create polls and assign a number of votes per user.
When voting, users can distribute their votes however they wish:
all votes in one option, 50/50 or any other way.

This app will probably break if it gets too many users at once since
no database was used.
